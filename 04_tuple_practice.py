# What is a Tuple?
# Tuples are like lists, but they are immutable, meaning once created, you cannot modify their elements (no adding, removing, or changing elements).

          #   creating tuple 


# my_tuple = (1,2,3,4)
# print(my_tuple)         # output = (1,2,3,4)
# print(type(my_tuple))   # output = <class 'Tuple'>

  


        # one value in tuple

# my_tuple = (5)
# print(my_tuple)
# print(type(my_tuple))    # output = <class 'int'>


# my_tuple = (5,)
# print(my_tuple)   # output = (5,)
# print(type(my_tuple))



       # count() method in tuple
# my_tuple = (1,2,3,2,5,2,7)
# print(my_tuple.count(2))     # output = 3



# my_tuple = (1,2,3,4,5)
# print(my_tuple.index(3))     # output = 2
